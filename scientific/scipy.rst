About Scipy
===========

The Scipy package is a package that provides common scientific tools for
Scientists, and consists mainly of a collection of functions.

If you are interested in finding out about Scipy,
click through to the main `SciPy Reference Manual
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/>`_ and skim the `tutorial
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/index.html>`_.  Keep
this repository of functionality in mind whenever you need some numerical
functionality that isn't in Numpy: there is a good chance it is in Scipy:

- Basic functions in Numpy (and top-level scipy)
- Special functions (scipy.special)
- Integration (scipy.integrate)
- Optimization (optimize)
- Interpolation (scipy.interpolate)
- Fourier Transforms (scipy.fftpack)
- Signal Processing (signal)
- Linear Algebra
- Statistics
- Multi-dimensional image processing (ndimage)
- File IO (scipy.io)
- Weave
