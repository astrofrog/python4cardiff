Cardiff University Python Workshop
==================================

.. note:: Please bring your laptop to the workshop!

The scope of the workshop is not to give a complete introduction to Python,
but instead to make you familiar with the basics of Python, numerical
analysis, plotting, and Astronomy packages, so that you can directly use it in
your work/research. The functionality is presented in such a way that
beginners in Python should be able to follow, but please ensure that you have
a functional Python distribution installed prior to the workshop.
